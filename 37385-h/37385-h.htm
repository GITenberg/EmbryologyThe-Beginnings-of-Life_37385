<h3>THE CELL AND THE INDIVIDUAL</h3>

<p>What is Embryology, and what is its significance or
interest to the ordinary educated man and woman?
The answer to the question is the justification for the
appearance of the following pages, and one may regard
it as a somewhat striking fact, that in the production
of a series of works of which this volume is one, those
responsible for the subjects should have deemed it
advisable to include Embryology.</p>

<p>Embryology may be defined as that part of the
science of Biology which deals with the formation of
a new individual or embryo. The definition itself ought
to be sufficient to explain the significance of the subject
for every one, because one can hardly conceive
of any more profoundly important knowledge than
that which tells of the mode of origin, manner of growth,
and ultimate birth of an entirely new being. In the
absence of such accurate knowledge it is quite obvious
that all one's ideas concerning the manner in which
the new individual is to be treated must have a more
or less haphazard, or at least empirical, basis. In fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>only when the science of Embryology, or the development
of the individual, becomes a part of the ordinary
everyday mental equipment of those who are responsible
for bringing into the world new individuals, and subsequently
protecting and handling them, will it be
reasonable to expect that these new individuals are
dealt with in the best possible manner. In a word
it is evident that education, using that term in the
very widest possible sense, can never be anything
more than a blind groping in the dark until those
into whose hands it is entrusted realise and know at
least the most important fundamental facts concerning
development. It is lack of this kind of knowledge
which has been responsible for so much of the mistaken
systems of the past in dealing with the young,
and it is the spread of this knowledge which alone is
the hope of better things in the future. Wherever
knowledge is absent superstition is rife, and in no
sphere of life is this more painfully obvious than in
connection with the subject which we are about to
study. It would have been entirely impossible for
many of the stupid and even cruel methods of mental
and physical treatment which have been meted out
to the young children in the past to have been tolerated
for a moment had this knowledge been available and
sufficiently widespread. Possessing it, a flood of light
is thrown upon the fascinating and otherwise obscure
problems of heredity; and thus it lays open the pages
of the past for those who care to read them. Possessing
it also it throws upon the mental screen pictures
of possibilities in the future for all those who have
eyes to see. So the study of Embryology links up
the past with the present and joins the present with
the future. Is it not, therefore, obvious that the study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of such a subject means dealing with problems the
importance of which it is impossible to exaggerate;
problems which the parent, the teacher, the social
reformer, the politician, and the philanthropist will
grapple with in vain unless they call in science to their
aid? Such is the meaning and significance of the
subject of our study.</p>

<p>In the widest sense of the word Embryology, therefore,
deals with all manner of living things, be they
plant or animal. But since our purpose here is to
state, as far as possible in the space at our disposal,
the facts which are of particular importance in relation
to the human subject, we shall only glance at the rest
of living creatures. A brief look at them, however, is
quite necessary in order to appreciate what follows.
Let us be quite clear of what we are in search. We
want to know as far as possible what it is that goes
to the making of a man. What is the origin of the
new individual? Where does the embryo come from?
What elements are concerned in its formation? Where
do these elements come from? How are they subsequently
built up into the type of the species to which
they belong? From what source do they gain their
nourishment? What influences of a degenerative
nature are likely to affect them? These are the
questions which it is the business of the Embryologist
to answer, and these are the questions the answers to
which afford the explanation of man in the making.
Surely they merely require to be stated that their
significance may be appreciated.</p>

<p>We may now glance very briefly at the simplest
facts which bear upon the subject, and which must
precede our detailed study. The necessity for reproduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and development is involved in the universal
fact of death. In all except the very simplest forms
of life&mdash;those consisting of one simple mass of protoplasm&mdash;the
individual sooner or later perishes, and if
it were not that there were some methods by means
of which the individuals could give rise to new individuals
obviously the species would come to an end.
No matter to what great age an individual animal
may live, and there are some such as the tortoises
which do live for centuries, sooner or later death overtakes
them, and in all, investigation of their structure
shows that nature has made provision for the carrying
on of the race by means of new individuals.</p>

<p>Every living creature, be that creature simple or
complicated, animal or vegetable, man or a jellyfish,
starts life as one single cell. The very simplest living
individuals never consist of anything else but one
single cell, and it is in these primitive forms of life
alone that what we call death can not be said to occur.
Such a simple cell, after living for a certain period,
simply divides itself into two halves, each of which
gradually assumes the size and shape of what we may
term the parent cell. The first individual has simply
become two separate individuals. These two in their
turn after another period of independent existence,
again each divide, thus giving rise to four, and so on.
Now here, although the original parent cell no longer
exists <i>as a cell</i>, the actual material of which it was
composed still exists in the cells which came into
existence as the result of this division. The original
cell, therefore, may be literally said to have been
deathless, or immortal, though not everlasting. This
is a profound thought, and one which must be grasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
at the very commencement of our study of development,
because it is one to which we shall have to recur
again and again when we come to study the cells which
give rise to human beings, in whom, too, there is a
deathless continuity of cell protoplasm, or germ-plasm
as it is then called. It is upon this fact that the whole
science of Embryology depends.</p>

<p>The important idea to be learned from observing
this process of reproduction in the single-celled animal
is this: that there is nothing here which we may term
the body of an animal as opposed to any of its parts.
The one cell is both body and organs, and everything
else; in itself it has the capacity of performing all the
functions necessary for life, including that of reproduction
for the perpetuation of the species. No part
of the cell is set on one side for any special purpose
such as happens in the bodies of higher animals. There
are no special elements which go to the producing of
the next generation, none of the cells which in a
mammal, for example, we call &ldquo;germ-cells.&rdquo; The
whole individual is one cell. In fact one might almost
say that there is no individual, but only race, or if
we regard the cell as an individual then it is all germ-plasm.
That is the important fact to be learned in
the reproduction of single cells.</p>

<p>There are some single cells, such as those of the
yeast, which reproduce in a slightly different manner,
namely, by budding off a portion of themselves and
finally becoming separate, and this might be regarded
as a slightly higher stage, in so far as the original cell
from which the bud came may be still identified; but
in reality the process differs very little from that first
described.</p>

<p>Then we may note that very low in the scale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
living things there is a process of reproduction known
as conjugation, in which, although the cells of the
species appear to be all alike, yet, nevertheless, two
of them join together for purposes of reproduction.
In other words we have here a process of cell-union
before we have the cell-division which follows. It is
important to note at this stage that the creatures
which we have mentioned, and even some more highly
organised, such as an am&oelig;ba, which has a nucleus,
go through these simple or complicated reproductive
processes in the total absence of anything which could
suggest a distinction of sex. In these cases the individuals
are obviously all of one sex, and, therefore, the
distinction of sexes into male and female is evidently
something which has been added later in the scheme
of evolution, not for the purpose of reproduction itself,
but for something which is to be added to that.</p>

<p>Then in the slightly higher animals and plants we
come to those in which many cells go to the making
of the individual, the multicellular individuals, and
amongst these we very soon see the origin of what
is termed specialisation of function. That is to say,
in these higher creatures which consist of many numbers
of cells arranged so as to form one individual, certain
cells are set apart for one purpose and others for
another. Some may be for digestion, some for purposes
of movement, and others for reproduction. Here
we have a new phenomenon, namely, the setting aside
of certain cells in a multicellular individual which
from the very beginning are capable of one function
alone, namely, reproducing the species. The higher
one goes in the scale of life the more striking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
obvious this fact becomes, and as we shall see when we
come to the vertebrate kingdom, this setting aside of
the cells which are to produce the individuals of the
next generation is the key to the solution of the most
difficult of our problems.</p>

<p>In these highest forms of life, however, the cell
itself is becoming a much more complicated thing
than that lowly form which we first noted as dividing
into two to form two new individuals. Indeed, the
cells in the highest animals and plants are immensely
complicated in their structures and functions, and
especially in connection with the changes which take
place in the nucleus of such cells. Not only the
nucleus but another small object within the cell which
is neither part of the nucleus nor part of the cell protoplasm,
also is very important, and this structure is
termed the &ldquo;centrosome.&rdquo; In fact this little body
apparently begins the whole process of cell-division by
itself dividing into two parts. Then the nucleus follows
suit, and ultimately the whole cell divides. The
nucleus itself is a complicated structure, as is especially
seen during the processes of division, in which
it breaks itself up into a number of thread-like portions,
and the number of these is always the same in any
given species, a fact which is of great importance in
reproduction. Why do we mention these apparently
dry details? Because in these minute and complicated
nuclear movements the whole problems which
are at the bottom of development and heredity lie.
The problems of life itself can only be solved by the
study of what takes place in these minute portions
of cells. It is here that the new formation of an
individual begins, and although it is no part of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
purpose here to detail all the complicated processes
of nuclear division, it is essential, in order to grasp the
meaning of our subject, that we should realize that in
the changes within the cell life with its variations
begins.</p>

<p>The study of these wonderful cell processes, a work
which demands the most patient investigation and
high technical skill, has reached such a stage that it
is a science of its own, and is called the science of
&ldquo;Cytology,&rdquo; or the science of cells, which has been
made possible only in comparatively recent years by
the invention of microscopes having great powers of
magnification, and by the application of elaborate
methods of staining to the cells themselves.</p>

<p>We can say no more about these processes here,
but the foregoing paragraphs may perhaps be sufficient
to show us how important it is to grasp these
simple facts of cell life in their bearing upon development
itself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PROBLEMS OF REPRODUCTION</h3>

<p>We have seen that in the higher types of animals and
plants the single individual is made up of not one but
millions and millions of cells united together for the
common purpose of the individual life, and that in
such complicated individualities some cells perform one
function while others perform others. A human individual
from this point of view, therefore, is an organised
community of cells all of which, however, sprang, in
the first place, from one single cell. That original single
cell is termed, in animal Embryology, the &ldquo;fertilised
ovum.&rdquo; It is popularly spoken of frequently as &ldquo;the
egg.&rdquo; All the other millions of cells are the direct
descendants of this fertilised ovum, or egg, even though
many of them eventually become extremely unlike the
original cell. In single-celled animals the offspring of
the original cell remain like the parent cell, but in the
highly complicated creatures the offspring split up into
a great many types of cells, owing to the very fact
that all remain adherent together to form the mass
of the body in order to carry out different functions.
So we find cells of one type in glands, of another type
in the brain, of another type in bones, of another
type in blood, and so forth. Nevertheless all of them
sprang from one original single cell. None of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
specialised types of cells, however, are capable of performing
any other function than their own. A bone-cell
cannot receive an impression, nor originate an
idea, any more than a brain-cell can secrete bile. Each
kind of cell has its own appointed duty. The most
important duty that can possibly be allotted to any
cell is obviously that of reproducing the individual
for the purpose of continuing the race or species. So
we find in higher animals that this function, like others,
is relegated to a special set of cells also derived from
the original single cell, and which are called &ldquo;the
germ-cells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving out of consideration the question of reproduction
in lower types of animals we may consider
the nature and origin of these cells in highest vertebrates,
such as the mammals, including man. Germ-cells,
which are derived from the tissues of a female
animal, are termed &ldquo;ova.&rdquo; Those which are derived
from the tissues of a male animal are termed &ldquo;sperms.&rdquo;
Notice that it is not these germ-cells themselves to
which the terms male and female, indicative of the
two sexes, are applied, but only to the individuals.
They are male and female; the germ-cells are of
neither sex. True the germ-cells from the male, <i>i.e.</i>
the sperms, differ in appearance when seen under the
microscope from those of the female, but there is no
reason to believe that there is any difference between
them in their capacity, for example, of transmitting
the characters of ancestors to succeeding generations.</p>

<p>At a certain stage in the life history of the animal
individual and after undergoing certain changes which
need not be considered here, these germ-cells, both
sperms and ova, have reached such a stage of maturity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
as to be capable of carrying on their sole function,
namely, that of reproducing the species. The actual
age in human beings, for example, at which this
maturity is reached varies very much in different
races, and in different individuals of the same race.</p>

<p>When reproduction is about to occur a union must
take place between a germ-cell from a male body with
a germ-cell from a female body; that is to say, a union
must take place between a sperm and an ovum. This
union takes place within the body of the female individual
and results in the fusion of the two cells into one
single cell, which is now termed a fertilised ovum.
This fertilised ovum, in virtue of this process of union,
is now able under suitable conditions of nutrition and
shelter, such as it obtains within the female organs of
reproduction, to divide and redivide again and again,
thus building up a new mass of cells as the result of
its division. The millions of cells so produced include,
as we have already seen, cells which have all the various
functions which are necessary for the continuation of
the life of a human individual; that is to say, that as
the result of this division of the fertilised ovum there
are produced first of all germ-cells to secure the still
further continuance of the race, and then multitudes
of all the other kinds of cells which gradually assume
the shape of an embryo or young individual, and
ultimately grow into a human being.</p>

<p>In all the highly complicated animals fertilisation by
union of germ-cells from male and female must precede
reproduction. The result eventually is this multicellular
individual composed of a number of different
kinds of cells each set apart for its own work. But
it is well to recognise that we may regard all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
cells as really of two kinds, namely, the germ-cells and
the others. That is to say, two kinds of cells are
produced as the result of fertilisation, namely, cells
whose business it ultimately will be to again take part
in a similar process of fertilisation, and so perpetuate
the species, and all the other cells which go to the
forming of the various body tissues of the individual
itself. In this way we get a simple classification of the
cells which form, for example, a human being, namely,
germ-cells and body-cells, the latter often being termed
&ldquo;somatic.&rdquo; The latter are, of course, in much greater
abundance than the germ-cells. They have to form
all the various elements, organs, limbs, and structures
known and described by the anatomist. The germ-cells
are a separate little group of themselves embedded
in the male and female reproductive organs for the
sake of nutrition, growth, and shelter, for many years,
until they again take part in the process of fertilisation.
Note carefully that no other cells in the body ever
unite together to produce a new individual except
germ-cells.</p>

<p>Somatic cells reproduce by dividing directly. Germ-cells
before they can do this require to be fertilised.
That is to say, the cell from the male (the sperm) must
fuse with the cell in the female (the ovum). As Dr.
Archdall Reid graphically states it, &ldquo;Only the germs
are marriageable; and, as we have just seen, in the
great majority of animals and plants they observe
the degrees of consanguinity very strictly, and do not
unite except with members of another cell-community,
and then only to found a new colony of cells, an offspring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are still some further considerations in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
with the subject of germ-cells and germ-plasm
which we must carefully consider before leaving this
part of our subject, Embryology. Everything depends
upon a perfectly clear understanding at this stage.
The facts themselves that have to be adduced in this
connection are comparatively few and simple. No
fairly educated person should have any difficulty whatsoever
in grasping them. Moreover, very fortunately
they are thoroughly well established and not in dispute.
But the reasoning which is based upon these few and
elementary facts, reasoning which is applied to the
methods of treatment of the individual which is produced,
may be very complicated and very debatable.
Various schools of thought and opinion exist according
to the attitude taken towards the facts, some of which
we have mentioned and others of which we are about
to detail. But the facts themselves are not debatable,
and we therefore see once more that their importance
at this stage cannot be exaggerated.</p>

<p>One or two very simple general propositions bound
up with the subject of Embryology, or individual
development, may be stated in order to focus attention
upon the nature of the problem under investigation.
Thus nobody will be found to question the fundamental
truth that children resemble their parents.
That is a commonplace of experience. Similarly no
one will be found to dispute another fundamental
fact, namely, that children differ from their parents.
This, too, is equally a commonplace of experience.
If we examine a million human beings we find that
they all possess certain features in common, certain
characteristics in virtue of which we recognize them
to be human beings. Nevertheless it is just as true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
that a careful examination of the same million people
reveals the true saying that no two of them are exactly
alike. Here then are two propositions equally true
within certain limits; namely, that all human beings
resemble each other, and that all human beings differ
from each other. There is resemblance; and there
is variation. These two things are universal because
of the existence and characteristics of germ-cells. We
may look at this a little closer.</p>

<p>Every species of animal, in the process of reproduction
brings forth offspring similar to itself. This
is expressed in the familiar proverb that &ldquo;like produces
like.&rdquo; One does not expect grapes from thorns,
nor is it possible to construct a silk purse out of a
sow's ear. But what is the explanation of this proverbial
fact? The answer is of great importance,
because although the fact itself is recognized as a
general principle in the reproduction of a species, it
is not sufficiently recognized in the full details of the
characters of that individual. Too many people are
still apt to expect to be able to produce grapes when
the plant is a thorn, and it is unfortunately all too
common to make heroic but quite futile attempts to
construct human silk purses out of human sows' ears&mdash;so
to speak&mdash;simply because of the ignorance of
the material which is being used. The most that can
be done is to give such material as is present the very
best opportunity of attaining its own utmost perfection;
and this, by the way, is vastly more than has
ever been done for any considerable number of the
human race.</p>

<p>But why this continuity of species? Why should
like always produce like? The answer has been sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by biologists ever since problems of life attracted man's
curiosity. All sorts of weird and fantastic theories
have been put forward at different times to account
for this simple fact, but it is only in comparatively
recent years that the real explanation has been forthcoming.
It is perfectly obvious that in order to secure
this continuity of racial resemblance there must be
something physical or material which is actually continuous
from generation to generation to account for
it. The immortal Darwin saw this very clearly, and
devoted much thought in the endeavor to find some
explanation of this very problem. The result was his
theory of Pangenesis which, ingenious as it was, was
ultimately shown to have no basis on fact. In his
effort to account for the fact that children resemble
their parents even in such minute details as the shape
of the nose, the colour of the eyes, and so forth, he
formulated the idea that the parents themselves probably
contributed multitudes of minute particles from
their own tissues to form the cells of their offspring.
He supposed, for example, that particles or gemmules
from the eyes, nose, hair, and so forth, of the parent,
or parents, in some way or other were fused together
and gave rise to the cells which ultimately produced
an embryo. Hence he thought the explanation of the
resemblance between parents and children. This was
his solution to the question of the physical continuity
between successive generations. It may be remarked
in passing that it is with something of pathos that one
reads in Darwin's own works his own evident opinion
that this theory of Pangenesis was a great discovery.
One gathers almost that he himself regarded it as of
greater importance than his work on natural selection.</p>

<p>In the course of time, however, the real actual basis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of physical continuity was shown to be something
quite different, and looking back now upon the history
of the discoveries in this connection during the last
generation one can easily imagine what speculations
there must have been in the absence of the facts which
are now known to embryologists.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>PROBLEMS OF REPRODUCTION (<i>continued</i>)</h3>

<p>The one outstanding discovery which has placed the
science of Embryology on an absolutely firm basis,
and which has made clear so many of the facts, which
were previously puzzling, is this: <i>that the germ-cells
which give rise to new individuals are themselves produced
from pre-existing germ-cells</i>. The entire embryo,
or young infant, is derived from one single cell which
we have called the fertilised ovum, and that in its
turn was derived from the union of two germ-cells,
one from the male parent, and one from the female.
These two cells in their turn were also derived in a
straight line of descent from the fertilised ovum from
which each parent sprang. In other words there has
never been any conjugation between one fertilised ovum
and another in spite of the generations of cells which
have been produced between them. Put in another
way the body, or somatic cells, contribute absolutely
nothing to the original material or germ-plasm of which
the germ-cells are composed. They do not produce
them in any sense of the word whatsoever, despite the
popular opinion to the contrary. This is the great
discovery of modern Embryology. Until this was
known it was assumed that parents did produce the
cells from which their children sprang, and hence&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
was thought&mdash;the resemblance between them. The
fact is quite otherwise. No parent ever produces a
germ-cell, and the reason why children resemble parents
and ancestors is because the germ-cells which give rise
to individuals in successive generations are produced
from the germ-cells of the previous generation. The
line of descent or inheritance, therefore, is from germ-cell
to germ-cell, and not from parents. Unless the
reader makes himself absolutely familiar with the
thought expressed in these facts he will never understand
the science of Embryology.</p>

<p>Dr. Archdall Reid expresses this truth in the following
words. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&ldquo;The somatic cells of the parent, therefore,
as far as we know, contribute no living elements
to the child; they merely provide temporary shelter
and nutriment. The child, therefore, does not, as is
popularly supposed, resemble his parent because his
several parts are derived from similar parts of the
parent&mdash;his head from his parent's head, his hands
from his parent's hands, and so forth; he resembles
him only because the germ-plasm which directed his
development was a split-off portion of the germ-plasm
which directed the development of the parent. The
egg produces the fowl, but the fowl as a whole does
not produce the egg&mdash;only one cell from the fowl, the
fertilised ovum, produces it.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Diagram to show the origin of germ-cells and the embryo.</p>

<p>This is a startling thought, but it is one which a
moment's careful consideration will show is the only
conceivable explanation of all the facts of physical
continuity. Once it is grasped a flood of light is thrown
upon the whole science of Embryology. The individual
is seen to be literally a &ldquo;chip of the old block,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;old block&rdquo; means the whole sequence of
germ-cells which has preceded his formation. In the
light of this fact it is obvious why like produces like;
indeed, it is obvious that it must do so. Further, we
now understand at once that since one generation of
germ-cells directly produces those of the next, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
is no reason in the world why an individual should
not more nearly resemble a remote ancestor than his
own immediate parents. As a simple matter of fact
this frequently happens. He does so because the
germ-cell from which he sprang is composed of protoplasm
handed down in direct continuity by successive
generations of germ-cells from time immemorial. In
fact the problem in the light of this evidence is not
so much&mdash;as it always seems to the writer&mdash;to understand
why children resemble parents and ancestors, as
to understand how it is that they do not resemble
them more.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty now in explaining the fundamental
propositions with which we started, namely,
that children resemble their parents. There is no difficulty
in the understanding why a child resembles not
only its immediate parents, but even its ancestors.
There is even no difficulty in understanding why a
child should resemble its ancestors, even though it
does not resemble its parents. Given the simple truth
that the germ-plasm is continuous from one generation
to another, all these things become as clear as daylight.</p>

<p>But we also start with another general proposition,
namely, that children differ from their parents, and
it is this question of the variation in offspring which
must now claim our attention for a moment. By this
term we mean to convey the fact that although every
child has a real resemblance to its parents or its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
ancestors, it inevitably and invariably shows differences
even if these be more minute than the resemblances.
In other words the offspring of a human
being, though obviously and necessarily, from the
continuity of germ-plasm, it must be another human
being, is never exactly similar to any other. Now
these variations are many of them present from the
very beginning, they take their origin in the germ-plasm
of the two germ-cells which form the fertilised ovum.
They are, that is to say, many of them germinal in
origin. These must be carefully distinguished from
such characteristics as are afterwards acquired by the
child as the result of its adaptation to the environment
in which it passes its existence.</p>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of the present work
to enter into all the various theories which have been
put forward to account for the fact of variation. It
will be sufficient for our purpose here if the reader
remembers that it is a universal tendency in all living
protoplasm to exhibit variations. It is just as universal
as is its continuity of likeness. Moreover, in dealing
with the highest animals in which the fertilised ovum,
from which the embryo springs, is produced by the
union of germ-cells from male and female, one may
readily understand that the different lines of descent
of the male and female germ-cells may well be responsible
for the differences exhibited in the offspring.
Obviously the fertilised ovum, if it has to give rise
to a normal individual, cannot retain <i>all the characteristics</i>
which were possibly existent in both the male
germ-cells and the female germ-cells. Some of them
must be suppressed or got rid of, otherwise there would
be too many characters in the resulting offspring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
And, as a matter of fact, such a reduction does actually
take place in the physical tissue comprising the fertilised
cell, and it is probably at this stage that variations
take their origin.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, it is quite impossible that two
opposing characteristics can both be represented in
the fertilised ovum. One of them must be suppressed
or thrown out or got rid of in some way or another.
For example, the union of the male element and the
female element will give rise to an embryo which may
be eventually either a male or a female individual,
but cannot be both. There were possibilities of it
being either the one or the other at the beginning,
but since the two possibilities are mutually antagonistic,
one or the other must be eliminated. So again, supposing
that the colour of the eyes on the one side were
brown, and on the other side blue, the possibilities
are that the fertilised ovum may give rise to an individual
having either blue eyes or brown eyes, but, again,
not both.</p>

<p>A variation in offspring then may be regarded as a
difference between that offspring and the parents,
which is due to some change in the germ-plasm, some
difference, that is, between the germ-plasm from which
the parent sprang and that from which the next generation
arose. Such differences will, of course, be introduced
at the time of fertilisation. It is important to
keep clearly in mind the difference between a true
variation, in the sense that we have just used the term,
and a modification which is caused by the varying
effects of influences affecting parents and offspring.
Unless these two things are kept mentally distinct,
much confusion of thought is apt to arise.</p>

<p>The above statement does not necessarily mean that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the germ-plasm carried in the sperms and the ova
respectively, cannot be affected in any way. Indeed
one is forced to the conclusion that such germ-cells
must be influenced by the nutrient fluids supplied to
them, and by the existence of toxic or poisonous substances
in the body of the parent. It is quite conceivable,
and indeed inevitable, that the individual
embryo resulting from the fusion of such poisoned
germ-cells will show modifications, but these, however,
are not to be regarded in any sense as true variations,
for the simple reason that these modifications do not
take their origin in the actual germ-plasm itself, but
are simply the result of abnormal stimuli. Such modifications,
no matter in what direction they may be,
are, of course, not transmissible to the next generation,
for the very obvious reason that the germ-cells which
are to be concerned with the next generation have been
already produced. The germ-plasm itself passes on
unchanged in so far as its hereditary possibilities are
concerned. We see, therefore, that in order to think
clearly on this matter we must limit the meaning of
the word variation to such differences or changes in
germ-plasm which indicates some real change of an
inheritable nature. The term should not be used to
apply to a mere passing environment, in which the
germ-plasm happens to be, caused by the presence of
poisons, or similar factors.</p>

<p>Given then the fact that variations do constantly
and inevitably occur in offspring owing to new qualities
arising in germ-plasm itself, it is obvious that these
variations are either what are termed &ldquo;spontaneous,&rdquo;
or else they must be due to the action of the surroundings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
on the germ-plasm. By the term &ldquo;spontaneous,&rdquo;
in this connection, it is not meant that these
variations arise without cause or in a haphazard
manner. It is simply meant to imply that the present
state of our knowledge does not justify us in stating
what does actually cause the variation in germ-plasm,
or the laws in accordance with which such variations
occur. That they must be a matter of cause and effect
and law every biologist believes, but until the law
can be demonstrated, the term &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; may
well be retained to distinguish these variations from
those which arise by the obvious action of environment.
For example, the variations which occur as the
results of reproduction from two parents, do so because
of the mingling of the respective germ-cells, and such
variations come under the group of &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo;;
whereas changes induced on account of the food supplied,
or poisonous substances in fluids surrounding
germ-cells are not spontaneous, but environmental.</p>

<p>A point of great interest to the embryologists is
the question whether the differences of detail which
exist between children and their parents are of the
nature of spontaneous variations, taking their origin
in the germ-plasm itself, or mere modifications produced
by the action of the environment of the embryo.
Further, should both these factors play a part in producing
these differences, which is of greater importance,
and in what proportion? This question is elaborated
in great detail by Dr. Archdall Reid, in his work, <i>The
Laws of Heredity</i>, which ought to be read by every
intelligent citizen and parent who is interested in the
welfare of the young. In the main in this subject
we follow the ideas so ably put forward by him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
points out that the offspring of the same parents always
differ not only from the parents, but among themselves,
even if they be twins, and amongst the lower
animals every member of a litter of dogs, or pigs, or
kittens, shows differences in size, colour, activities,
temperament, and characteristics. Are those differences
due to the action of environment on the embryo
or do they take their origin in the germ-cells from
which the individuals came? Inasmuch as a litter
of puppies is subjected to precisely the same environment
during the whole time of development, it is
perfectly obvious that such differences as they exhibit
at the time of birth must have been germinal, an
identical environment could not by any stretch of the
imagination be held responsible for producing variations.
They, therefore, must be of the spontaneous
variety. Of course it may be argued that even during
development the environment of each embryo within
the mother is not identical, but it will be a gross abuse
of such argument to therefore conclude that such
minute differences of surroundings could account for
one puppy being big and black, and another one small
and brown in the same litter; or that one should
resemble one parent, another the other, and a third
a remote ancestor. It is, therefore, clear that <i>some
at least</i> of the variations in offspring are germinal or
spontaneous in origin, and not in any way due to the
environment of the embryo.</p>

<p>The question remains whether all variations are due
to this cause or whether some may be traced to environmental
factors. One of the best lines of argument
and investigation on this point is that of the bacteriologist,
because microbes with which he is concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
may be regarded as equivalent in this matter to germ-cells,
all microbes being unicellular. The problems of
the germ-cell, and its heredity, therefore, are very
similar in both cases. Tried by this test we may ask
whether the changes produced in these unicellular
organisms by the action of their environment are, or
are not, inherited as variations. No one doubts for
a single moment that a microbe as well as a germ-cell
may be changed, or injured, or improved, according
to its own special environment. What is in dispute
is whether that change remains fixed in the succeeding
generations to which these unicellular cells give rise.
It is precisely here that the bacteriologist can offer
evidence of a most important character. He will tell
us that it is quite easy to change many of the characteristics
of a microbe by altering its environment,
which is undoubtedly true, but the further statement
that they change because their germ-plasm is affected
directly by the environment is not necessarily true.
These organisms and germ-cells are composed of protoplasm
whose ultimate constitution permits of their
varying spontaneously. These variations are obviously
to enable them to adapt themselves to the tissues of
the animal in which they are living, and these variations
also, or modifications as they really are, are
usually lost when that environment is no longer
existent. In other words they proceed no further
than to allow the microbe to exist in a new environment.
This seems to point undoubtedly to the fact
that they are caused by selection of true variations.
In other words what is ultimately produced is a condition
of the germ-cell in which it becomes very highly
resistant to any influence immediately exerted upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
by the environment, and so continues to live in successive
generations without any further modification.
The conclusion, therefore, is, in Dr. Reid's words,
&ldquo;that the germ-plasm is both spontaneously variable
and highly resistant to the direct action of the environment.
In other words we must believe that in any
species that is not undergoing extinction spontaneous
variations greatly preponderate over those which are
caused by the direct action of the environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This quality of single cells, that is to say of the
germ-plasm of all species which continue to exist, in
virtue of which it resists very strongly any efforts to
change it, is a very important matter to grasp. Without
it it is quite obvious that no species could maintain
its characteristic features for any length of time. Were
it not for this resistant power, germ-plasm would be
easily destroyed or continually and readily changed.
The descendants from such continually changing germ-plasm
would themselves be of such infinite variety
that there would be no such thing as a definite species,
so that there is no doubt whatever that germ-plasm
has become, probably by the action of natural selection,
extremely resistant to all influences of an environmental
character.</p>

<p>That does not mean, of course, that germ-plasm
cannot be damaged, or weakened, or changed in its
tendencies. It does mean that when it is so changed
it is principally as the result of injury, which may be
indeed so severe as to destroy the germ-plasm itself.
It would seem as if the inherited tendencies of germ-cells
were so intimately bound up in the constitution
of those cells as to be almost a matter of life and death
of the cells. If they be so interfered with as to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
destroyed it is hardly possible for the cell itself to continue
to exist. One of the most interesting examples of
this resistance of germ-cells to their environment is in
connection with some human diseases which have existed
from time immemorial, diseases the descriptions of which
are to be found given quite accurately in the most
ancient documents, but in spite of the fact that human
germ-cells have been subject to the hostile surroundings
which such human diseases involve they themselves
have not changed to any great extent. That is to say
they still produce a type of embryo and offspring practically
identical with that that always was produced.</p>

<p>The same truth applies to the cells which make up
the body of the embryo and the individual, as well
as to the germ-cells. The body-cells, those which
make up bone, and muscle, and gland, and so forth,
are constantly exposed to all sorts of influences which
must tend to damage them so far as it is possible for
the cells to be damaged and still live. These body-cells
are sometimes starved, sometimes poisoned with
alcohol and drugs, frozen by extremes of temperature,
over-worked by too much physical strain, and so on,
and if it were possible for such external influences to
change the type of cells of their offspring we should
expect to see it here. But it does not occur. The
internal hereditary tendencies of these cells are so
strong, and so intimately bound up with the life of
the cells themselves, that when they divide and produce
others these others are precisely similar to the
parent cells, in spite of all the unfavourable environment
in which they have been. Slight variations do,
of course, occur, but these are chiefly of a germinal
or spontaneous nature, and not due to the environment.</p>

<p>This thought gives us some vague and imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
idea of how immensely complex the constitution of
germ-plasm must be. This germ-plasm is very often
subjected to all sorts of unfavourable conditions, especially
those of alcohol and toxins, and such conditions
have been acting upon it more or less for an immense
number of generations, and yet the resistance to modification
at the hands of these internal factors is so
great that all the processes which follow upon the
fertilisation of the ovum, all the thousand complications
which thereafter ensue in the building up of the
young embryo are hardly ever interfered with. When
they are markedly interfered with such interference
generally involves the death of the embryo.</p>

<p>The conclusion arrived at on this subject by Dr.
Archdall Reid, after a very careful and extensive
inquiry into all the evidence from many points of view,
is stated by him as follows: &ldquo;Though variations may
result from the direct action of the environment, such
variations are, in effect, always injuries, and are of
rare occurrence in individuals who survive and have
offspring. Adaptation (<i>i.e.</i> evolution) depends almost
exclusively on spontaneous variations. These do not
imply damage to the germ-plasm, but are products of
its vital activity. Occurring in vast abundance all
round the specific and parental means, they supply
the sole material for Natural <ins title="Selection.">Selection.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;We conceive the germ-plasm, then, as living and
active, closely adjusted to its environment, growing,
dividing, varying, capable of being destroyed and injured,
but resisting death and injury, and within limits capable
of repairing damage and returning to its original state&mdash;as
behaving exactly as a living individual does.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE MAKING OF A MAN</h3>

<p>Having in this brief preliminary consideration of the
fundamental facts upon which the science of Embryology
is based cleared the ground as far as possible,
we may now summarise, in a few simple statements,
the point at which we have arrived in order that we
may proceed at once to the more detailed study of
the actual development of the embryo itself.</p>

<p>We are in search of as clear a statement as possible
of the origin of the many and varied characteristics
which go to the formation of a human embryo, and
hence to the making of an individual. The variation
in these many characteristics accounts for the differences
in individualities. No two individuals are exactly
similar whatever be the standard by which we
estimate them. This is true morally, ethically, and
physically. In each of these spheres there are to be
found good, bad, and indifferent individuals, but
whichever they are it is quite obvious that the result
has been brought about by the influence of all the factors
of heredity and environment acting upon the capacities
which were originally implanted in the germ-plasm.
An individual is the resultant of the play upon one
man's-worth of human material of all forces which have
acted, or are acting, upon that kind and amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
material. Even though two children of the same
parents be brought up under what are to all appearances
identical circumstances, they differ from the very
beginning from each other and their parents. This
is true even of physical characteristics, and even more
markedly in mental features. The fact is&mdash;and it is
one which is not sufficiently recognised&mdash;that the formation
of an individual from an embryo, the making
of a man, is a biological problem fundamentally.</p>

<p>The following are the principal facts which we have
at this stage to bear in mind.</p>

<p>All living creatures are made of cells, the physical
basis of which is protoplasm. The simplest creatures
consist of one such mass of protoplasm; higher
organisms consist of more than one, and often of millions,
in which case they adhere together. Cells multiply
by dividing into two, the protoplasm of the mother-cell
giving rise to that of the daughter-cells. A human
embryo, therefore, which is going to give rise to an
adult individual is a community consisting of an enormous
number of cells, the whole of which have descended
from one common ancestor, a single cell known
as a fertilised ovum. True, these descendants break
up into many types of cells in order that different
functions may be performed by special tissues, but
none of these special cells can do everything that is
necessary for the life of the whole individual; they
can only play their own special small part. They can
do nothing towards continuing the species of the individual.
This duty, like others, is imposed upon
one particular group and kind of cells, namely, the
germ-cells, which do nothing else in the animal economy
but furnish the means for the continuity of the race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Although they lie within the tissues of the embryo,
and afterwards of the adult, they take no part in the
life of that embryo or adult. They undergo certain
changes in themselves which are to fit them for their
ultimate destiny and function, but they contribute
nothing to the output of energy on the part of the individual.
When these are derived from a female they
are termed &ldquo;ova&rdquo;; when from a male they are termed
&ldquo;sperms.&rdquo; They themselves are neither male nor
female, they are merely protected and nourished by
the general mass of cells which constitutes the male
and female individual.</p>

<p>When a male germ-cell or sperm unites with a
female germ-cell or ovum, within the female body,
fertilisation of the ovum takes place, and this gives
rise to the fertilised germ-cell from which is to arise
first the germ-cells or direct descendants of itself, and
secondly the embryo in which these germ-cells will
come to lie. This happens by the repeated and continued
division of the fertilised germ-cell, a division
which constitutes growth, and which under suitable
conditions of nourishment and protection and exercise
will ultimately produce a human being. The great
mass of the cells of this individual, the body or
somatic cells, take no part whatsoever in giving
rise to the germ-cells of the next generation. These
are produced from the pre-existing germ-cells, and
from no other source, and it is for this reason
alone that the phenomena of heredity are possible
and that one generation is directly continuous with
its predecessors. In fact heredity may be defined
as the relationship which exists between successive
generations.</p>

<p>We therefore see that the embryo, or the individual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
is formed from one, and one only, of the first products
of the division of the fertilised germ-cell, the rest of
these products forming the other body tissues. This
idea of the continuity of the germ-plasm is the greatest
contribution of modern embryological research. It is
quite fundamental, and no clear understanding of what
is involved in the making of a man is possible without
it. It teaches us that the line of ancestry and heredity
is from one generation of germ-cells to another, directly,
and never through the individual from the embryo,
which, indeed, is a mere side product in the continued
chain of events. The individual is practically the
trustee of the germ-cells, but not their maker. No
embryo, and no individual, ever made germ-cells;
the latter existed first. The object of the embryo
is obviously to protect and nourish the germ-cells
which have been placed within it, so that they may
be available in due time for the production of further
germ-cells, and so for the continuity of the race. Hence
it is the all-pervading truth of natural selection that
the interest and survival of the individual is almost
of no account; that of the species or the race being
the paramount consideration.</p>

<p>Once these facts be grasped there is no longer any
difficulty in understanding why the process of reproduction
in any given species always results in the formation
of embryos which resemble each other in all
the main characters of their species. It could not be
otherwise, because they come from portions of identically
similar material, a common germ-plasm. In
other words, the individual inherits nothing from its
parents. He merely receives in his turn the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
inheritance in the germ-plasm which was there a
generation before him.</p>

<p>In so far as there has been no germinal variation
he and they will be similar. Hence the common
observation that the child resembles the parent. True,
so he does; but not because he gets his characters
from them, but simply because he and they obtain
their characteristics from a common source. To many
this thought will be, perhaps, a new one. It is one
of the most interpreting ideas which science has given
us, and in its absence no real grasp of the origin of the
physical, mental, and other characters if there be any,
of the embryo can be understood. The present writer
has elsewhere summarised this thought as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man is composed partly of characteristics, which
are derived from pre-existing germ-cells, and over the
possession of which he has no control whatsoever.
Be they good, bad, or indifferent, these characteristics
are his from his ancestry in virtue of his inheritance.
The possession of these characteristics is to him a
matter of neither blame nor praise, but of necessity.
They are inevitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The embryo then which is to form the individual
starts its career with a certain number of innate germinal
characteristics which manifest themselves in the
form of tendencies to grow in this direction or that.
During the period of gestation a good many of these
tendencies are well developed while a good many more
only manifest their exact nature in later life. But it
is upon the basis of these tendencies&mdash;and upon no
other&mdash;that the making of the individual is possible.
They represent the total assets available for the formation
of character. Nothing of any new <i>kind</i> can
be added to them.</p>

<p>All that can be done under the best conceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
circumstances is so to arrange the environment and
surroundings of the embryo, and the subsequent individual,
so that these tendencies are acted upon in such
a way that the best are developed, and the worst eliminated.
It must be remembered that it is under the
constant action of everything that constitutes the environment
of an embryo that the mass of body-cells
gradually grows into a recognisable human personality.</p>

<p>The question then arises, What are the factors
external to the embryo which cause these germinal
tendencies to become active and fully developed?
These factors are those of (<i>a</i>) nourishment; (<i>b</i>) use,
or exercise; and (<i>c</i>) injury. In the case of the human
embryo by far the most important of these three
factors is the first. A proper supply of nourishment
and food, that is to say maternal nutrition of adequate
quantity, is sufficient up to the time of birth to cause
the inborn tendencies in all the body-cells gradually
to assume the special characteristics of muscle, bone,
gland, nerve, and so forth, which make the human
embryo. After the period of embryonic life is over,
the stimulus of nutrition is still sufficient for some of
these body-cells. Thus we find that the hair, the
teeth, the internal ears, and the organs of reproduction,
all grow to their full development in the absence
of any other factor or stimulus than that of nutrition.
But, as we also know, this simple stimulus is not
sufficient for most of the other body tissues to develop
properly. They require the additional stimulus of
exercise which, indeed, may be said to begin even
in the life of the embryo. After that it is quite hopeless
to expect a healthy embryo to develop into a
fine child unless to the stimulus of nutrition there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
added that of exercise. It is from the varying quantities
and qualities of the three factors of nourishment,
exercise, and injury, that part of the explanation is
found for the variation in individuals of the same
family. Starting with a good many of the same
inborn tendencies none of them afterwards receive
quite the same kind and amount of these stimuli,
under the action of which they develop. And so we
reach the second point, namely, that, in addition to
innate characters certain others are subsequently
acquired by the embryo of the individual in response
to particular stimuli acting from without.</p>

<p>Here we are upon ground which is more or less in
our own choice or control. It is impossible to alter
germ-plasm; but it is not impossible to control the
environment in which it exists. To these two groups
of characters, the germinal and those acquired under
stimulus, there is to be added the third group which
we have mentioned on a previous page, namely, those
that are usually termed variations. For example, one
occasionally finds that one individual in a family, the
parents of which, and the other members of which,
are quite normal, may be born with six fingers instead
of five. Similarly one of a family may have a variation
in the direction of an extraordinary capacity for
the acquisition of knowledge of certain types. Hence
the genius in music, mathematics, memory, morality,
and so forth. As we have seen, these variations are
termed spontaneous, to express the fact that we are
at present ignorant of the laws in accordance with
which they arise, though, of course, it is understood
that those laws must exist.</p>

<p>We have now surveyed the whole field of the possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
origin of the characters of an embryo, and these may
be summed up in the following tabular statement.</p>

<table id="p43" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" summary="Characters">
 <tr>
   <td rowspan="8" valign="middle">An Embryo is made up of</td>
   <td rowspan="8" valign="middle" style="padding-left: .5em; padding-right: .5em;">
     <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="bracket">
      <tr>
      <td class="bblt">&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
   </td>
   <td align="left">A. Inborn Characters&mdash;</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td align="left" style="padding-left: 2em;">(<i>a</i>) Inherited (growing under the stimulus of nutriment).</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td align="left" style="padding-left: 2em;">(<i>b</i>) Variations.</td>
 </tr>

 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td align="left" style="padding-left: 2em;">(<i>c</i>) By injury.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>The differences in individuals with which we are also
familiar, are due to the varying proportions of the
characters in the above table, and the characters
themselves are those which constitute all the possibilities
for any given person.</p>

<p>Should the reader doubt this, or be sceptical as to
whether the whole of the making of a man is contained
in the above simple scheme, it would not be difficult
for him to convince himself that the statement is a
true one. Let him put down this book and take a
sheet of paper and a pencil. Rule the sheet of paper
into three columns, and at the top of each column
place a heading as follows: Inherited; Acquired;
and Variations. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<table width="50%" border="1" rules="all" summary="Rules">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Inherited.</td>
    <td align="center">Acquired.</td>
    <td align="center">Variations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
    <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Let him then proceed to think of as many definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
characteristics of his own as he possibly can, and then
enter these characteristics in the column which he
deems appropriate. It will be found that with the
great majority of characteristics no difficulty will be
presented, and it will be quite impossible to think
of anything which is a physical part of himself, which
cannot be placed in one or other of these three categories.
Even though there may be a little difficulty
as to which column should claim the entry, it will be
found that this is due rather to indecision on the part
of the reader than to anything else. It is not because
he can imagine any other origin for the trait which
is for the moment puzzling, but simply because he
may be uncertain as to whether it is an inborn character,
or one due to the subsequent action of circumstances.
Thus he will have no difficulty in placing
in the first column such characteristics as the possession
of one nose, two eyes, the colour of his eyes,
perhaps the shape of his nose, and so forth, these all
being germinal inherited characters. Equally simple
is it to see that in the second column must be placed
such parts of his individuality as speech, writing, the
<i>size</i> of his muscles at the moment, and so forth. These
obviously have resulted from the action of circumstances
on inborn capacities. No embryo can speak
or write, though it has within it the inherited capacity
to enable it to learn such things. Finally he may
find it difficult to think of anything to place under
the heading of &ldquo;Variations&rdquo;; but, on the other
hand, should he happen to be a genius in music or
mathematics, or the possessor of six toes or a black
mole on his arm, these will indicate to him at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
that they are of the nature of &ldquo;Variations.&rdquo; (It must
be remembered, however, that they may be transmitted
to successive generations, in which case they
become germinal characters.)</p>

<p>In a similar way if the reader desires to follow out
this analysis of the characters which make an embryo,
and which, therefore, afterwards comprise the possibilities
of an individual from the point of view of the
stimuli under which they are developed, he may easily
do so. Another sheet of paper similarly divided into
three columns with the headings &ldquo;Nutrition, Use, and
Injury,&rdquo; will enable him to see how his individual
characteristics have attained their present development
as the result of one or other of these stimuli
acting upon the germinal or inherited tendencies.
Without going into detail in this matter one may
simply note that under the heading of &ldquo;Injury&rdquo; will
come all those parts of himself of which he has become
possessed as the result of disease or accident, whether
this be physical, mental, or moral.</p>

<p>Now we have completed what was necessary to
arrive at our conclusion of what it is that goes to the
making of an embryo, and therefore of a human being&mdash;a
personality. The conclusion is that every characteristic
which it is possible for an individual under
any circumstances whatsoever to possess is traceable
ultimately to the action which takes place between
his inherited tendencies and his natural environment.
This environment, whether it be physical, mental,
moral, ethical, spiritual, or whatever other can be
imagined, can only produce the whole individual by
means of acting upon what is already present. To
that material nothing can be added <i>except in the environment</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
from that material nothing can be taken away;
the most that can be done in this direction is to hinder
its growth by suitable procedures. Hence the truth
of the phrase that &ldquo;education is nothing more than
the giving or withholding of opportunity.&rdquo; Hence it
is so entirely true that it is impossible to make a silk
purse out of a sow's ear, or to gather grapes from
thorns. The importance of thoroughly realising these
simple facts of embryology should at this stage be
obvious. They constitute possibly the most important
lesson which is demanding attention at the hands of
modern teachers, parents, and sociologists.</p>

<p>One further word before we leave this part of our
subject. It is obvious that of our total characteristics
some are acquired and some are inherited, and the
question then arises, How much is inherited in an
embryo or individual, and therefore unavoidable, and
how much acquired? It would be beyond the scope
of our subject in this place to enter into detail in this
matter, but it would not be right to pass the question
by without pointing out that a careful analysis of
individual characteristics will show that under the
heading of &ldquo;Inherited&rdquo; will be found principally the
physical traits. When the reader comes to estimate
his mental and moral characteristics, a very few
moments' careful thought will prove most conclusively
to him that these must be entered up under the heading
of &ldquo;Acquired.&rdquo; If it were not so progress in those
directions would be practically hopeless. But plain as
is this truth, it is one which is far from being realised
by many well-educated people.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>FERTILISATION AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>We may now turn our attention to the consideration
of some of the phenomena connected with the early
processes in the development of the embryo. We may
assume that the eggs and sperms have reached such a
stage in their life history that they are now mature.
All that is necessary in order that the development
of an embryo should result is that union of the two
elements should take place. Many complicated changes
have occurred in the constitution of these eggs and
sperms before this stage is reached, but into these we
need not enter. It will suffice for our purpose to
assume that they are now mature. Then as the result
of a natural instinct which suggests certain thoughts
and emotions to the male and female animals, which
in turn are followed by certain definite acts, the sperm-cell
from the male and the egg or ovum-cell from the
female are brought into contact. This contact takes
place in such circumstances that the united elements
are able to be protected and nourished and so, fertilisation
having thus occurred, development begins.</p>

<p>The characters of these two wonderful cells, which
by their union ultimately cause the production of an
embryo, are briefly as follows. The element from the
male, the sperm that is, is an extremely minute cell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
which is only about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>300</sub> of an inch in length. As
seen under a high power of the microscope it is composed
of two portions which are spoken of as a head
and the tail. The former is a flat, oval part, and
behind this is the rounded body ending in the long
tail which is some four-fifths of the total length. This
long tapering tail gives to the sperm its power of movement,
for it is supposed that as the result of the rotating
or lashing movements of this tail the cell is propelled.
Indeed its rate of motion has been actually studied,
and estimated to be at about one-eighth of an inch per
minute.</p>

<p>The cell contributed by the female, the ovum that
is, has quite a different structure and microscopical
appearance. Compared with most cells it is rather
large, almost round in shape, having a diameter of
about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>120</sub> of an inch. Up to the time we are now considering,
this cell, along with a great many others like
it, has been stored within the female ovary, from which
organ an ovum periodically escapes. Unless fertilisation
takes place by union with a sperm the discharged
ovum perishes. Should, however, the sperm-cell be
available, and should it have been able to reach a
situation at which fertilisation can take place within,
the chain of events which constitute development
begins. But before fertilisation can take place the
ovum has undergone what is called the process of
maturation, in which it divides twice, giving off two
small portions of itself in the process. The result of
this is that half the number of chromosomes in the
ovum are lost. This process of maturation has already
taken place in the sperm before it leaves the body of
the male.</p>

<p>When these two cells meet, the actual fusion of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
material takes place, the head of the sperm penetrating
into the substance of the ovum, and the body of the
sperm completely fusing with the nucleus of the ovum.
This gives rise to what is called the &ldquo;segmentation
nucleus.&rdquo; It will be observed that we now have a
cell in which the full number of chromosomes for that
particular species is represented once more. But
this full number has now been made up from two
different sources, half from the elements contributed
from the male, and half from those of the female. It
is at this stage that the inherited tendencies, carried
in the germ-plasm on the two sides of the ancestry,
become mingled, and from thenceforward the division
of the fertilised cell into many cell-descendants goes
on with extreme rapidity.</p>

<p>Two different lines of germ-plasm have thus been
intimately mingled, and the actual significance of this
mingling has given rise to one of the most acutely
debated points in all the problems of heredity. Put
into quite plain language that problem is&mdash;What is
the function of sex? It is no part of our task here to
answer that problem, but it is of interest to point out
precisely at what stage it occurs in embryology. The
obvious answer, however, may be advanced that the
function of sex is to mix the characters of the parents
in such a way that some from each source will be found
in the offspring. But how these are mixed, whether
as painters mix two colours and produce a third, or
as two packs of cards are mixed having different
coloured backs, is quite another matter.</p>

<p>The fertilised ovum now commences to form a number
of successive generations of cells, and this it does by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
dividing into two, four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two,
and so forth, until a number of cells have been produced
which arrange themselves into the form of a
ball. The surface of this ball resembles
that of a mulberry, each
elevation corresponding to a cell.
This mass is termed by embryologists
&ldquo;the morula.&rdquo; (See Fig. 1.)</p>

<div class="figleft">

        alt=""
        title="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Next, within this morula some of
the cells become condensed into one
particular portion, leaving a space
which contains fluid. The ball is now no longer solid,
but has a portion consisting of cells, and a portion
consisting of fluid. It is now called a &ldquo;blastocyst.&rdquo;

<p>The cross-section of this shows the cells projecting
into a cavity. This is the
first attempt of the fertilised
ovum to form itself into the
different layers, which are
ultimately going to give rise
to all the different tissues of
the embryo. But it is interesting
to know at this stage
that the outer layer of cells,
those representing a margin in
the figure, has nothing to do
with the forming of the embryo
at all, but gives rise to a structure whose function
afterwards is to be that of nourishing the growing
embryo.</p>

<p>The next obvious change is that the cells at the lower
portion of the mass which projects into the cavity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
appear to get flattened out&mdash;at any rate they obviously
arrange themselves in a definite and separate layer;
and this layer in its turn proceeds to go on growing by
division of its cells in such a way as to form another
little closed cavity within the larger one. This cavity
is termed the &ldquo;yolk sac.&rdquo; (See Fig. 3.) Then another
little cavity occurs, this time within the original projecting
cell-mass. This cavity is termed by embryologists
the &ldquo;amniotic cavity,&rdquo; and the cells which
line it, and which in their turn become arranged as a
separate layer, form what is termed the &ldquo;embryonic
ectoderm.&rdquo; (See Fig. 3.)</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>It is in this region, and in that of the yolk sac which
lies just underneath it, that the future growth of the
embryo itself occurs, and the portion is therefore
termed the &ldquo;embryonic area.&rdquo; (See Fig. 3.)</p>

<p>Up to this point we have seen that two layers of
cells have appeared, one round the yolk sac, called the
&ldquo;entoderm,&rdquo; and the other lining the amnion, called
the &ldquo;ectoderm.&rdquo; After these two germinal layers
have made their appearance, a third layer comes into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
existence, which, because it begins growing from the
embryonic area, and lies between the two already
mentioned, has received the name of the &ldquo;mesoderm.&rdquo;
This third germinal layer divides into two portions
before very long, and the space between these two is
that in which the body cavity itself subsequently
arises. One part of the mesoderm, situated near one
end of the embryonic area, is specially important,
because in it are formed the blood-vessels which supply
the embryo, and which ultimately afterwards becomes
the &ldquo;umbilical cord,&rdquo; which forms the connection
between embryo and mother.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>EARLY DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>The early development of the embryo now proceeds
rapidly, and its appearance at the stage we have just
been describing is thus stated by Dr. R. W.
Johnstone:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the ovum at this stage be looked at from above,
the embryonic area appears as a small shaded oval.
The shading is due to an increased growth of cells,
because here the three germinal layers&mdash;embryonic
ectoderm, mesoderm, and entoderm&mdash;are in contact.
At one end a patch of darker shading indicates a still
greater growth of cells. Running forward from this
is a band&mdash;the <i>primitive streak</i>&mdash;in the centre of which
lies a darker line&mdash;the <i>primitive groove</i>. At the far
(anterior) end of the primitive groove there is a dark
spot&mdash;Hensen's node&mdash;from which still another streak
runs forward, the head process. Later, in front of
the primitive streak, a thickened band of ectoderm
appears, broadening out posteriorly. The edges of
this band rise up to form two folds, which meet anteriorly.
The groove between them is the <i>medullary
groove</i>, and ultimately they fold over and unite to form
the <i>neural canal</i>. (See Fig. 4.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Along the line of the primitive streak all three
germinal layers are in contact. Superficial to it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the amnion, and below it is the yolk sac. The embryonic
area is the only part of the ovum which has to do
with the subsequent development of the embryo;
the other parts of the blastodermic vesicle become
subservient as nutritive or supporting structures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this stage, and for the first three weeks of its
existence, the embryo is a &lsquo;flat disc floating on the
surface of the yolk sac.&rsquo; (M'Murrich.)&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/img_054.png" width="700" height="201"
        alt=""
        title="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>This is followed by a folding of the embryo, due to
the enlarging of the amniotic cavity, the result being
to form what may be termed a &ldquo;head-fold&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;tail-fold.&rdquo; A further fold, however, occurs at the
sides which bend in, so that the whole embryonic mass
at this stage comes to form an incomplete tube, the
incomplete portion being the lower aspect of that
tube. This remains open. In due time this lower,
or ventral portion, becomes completely closed, except
just at one point. This point is where the communication
exists between the inside of the tube, which is
the embryo, and the yolk sac. A part of the yolk sac
is thus included in the embryo itself, and this has an
important bearing upon future development, because
in the course of time this part comes to be the alimentary
tract of the growing embryo. The canal which joins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the yolk sac to the internal gut of the embryo (the
vitelline duct) ultimately forms, together with part
of the yolk sac, the umbilical cord. This cord, which
at the time of birth is artificially severed in order to
free the fully developed embryo, is at this stage connected
to the hinder part of the body of the embryo.
As the latter grows, however, it elongates still more
behind, in what we should regard as the tail region in
animals which had a well-marked tail. As a matter
of fact, at a little later stage than this there is quite a
conspicuous tail in the human embryo, which, however,
comes to be embedded in the tissues later on, and so
never forms any external appendage.</p>

<p>So that at this stage we have the embryo representing
a mass of cells which have gradually arranged
themselves, and been arranged, in the form of a tube
more or less bent, and attached near its hinder end
to the tissues which are afterwards to represent the
umbilical cord.</p>

<p>We have neglected to describe the organs and
structures which are developed after fertilisation as a
further means of protecting the developing embryo. We
have done this of set purpose, because these structures&mdash;known
as the &ldquo;trophoblast&rdquo;&mdash;require a considerable
amount of technical knowledge to understand.
Any detailed description of them, therefore, would be
out of place here. All that is necessary for us to say
is that they are intended to serve as a means of nutrition
for the developing embryo, and take no part in
the actual formation of its cells and organs. One
portion of it, however, has another function which may
be mentioned. It secretes, it is supposed, a kind of
ferment which has the power of dissolving or digesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
other cells, and this is of great importance at one stage
of development&mdash;namely, when the fertilised ovum
comes to reach the womb, or uterus, in which it is to
pass the rest of its developing stage. It is believed
that some of the cells in the wall of the uterus are dissolved
and digested immediately round the ovum
itself, which thus comes to lie in a cavity in the uterine
wall. This process being carried still further allows the
ovum to sink deeper and deeper into the lining membrane
of the uterus. Ultimately the point of entrance,
where the cells were digested, is closed up by the formation
of a clot of blood poured out at that spot, and
which thus entirely covers in the ovum. The latter
now comes to lie absolutely embedded in the wall of
the uterus in a cavity which it has itself formed. It
does not, however, occupy the whole of the cavity, but
is surrounded by blood which is escaping from the
minute blood-vessels of the wall in which the cavity
has been made. This blood is, of course, the maternal
blood. &ldquo;Thus we have the ovum completely embedded,
lying free in a tiny cavity in the mucous membrane
lining the uterus&mdash;a cavity full of blood, in which the
ovum lies bathed, and from which it presumably
absorbs nourishment by osmosis through its trophoblast.&rdquo;
(R. W. Johnstone.)</p>

<p>The uterine wall, after this embedding of the ovum
within it, undergoes a remarkable growth at this position,
concerning which a word must be said. Under
normal conditions this wall is smooth, or nearly so,
but probably there are upon it some slight irregularities
or projections which are sufficient to catch the ovum
when it enters the uterine cavity. Apparently it may
be arrested in this way at any part of the wall, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
that spot it becomes embedded in the manner we have described
above. The lining membrane of the uterus under
ordinary conditions measures about one-eighth of an inch
in thickness, but, after the ovum has become embedded
in it, it begins to increase until it reaches as much as
half an inch. Underneath this lining membrane lies
the muscular part of the uterine wall. The ovum
itself is embedded about the middle depth of the lining
membrane, but as it continues to grow, and increases
in size and dimensions it projects more and more into
the uterine cavity, that being the direction of least
resistance. Before very long the embryo, as it now is,
has reached such a size in its growth that it entirely
fills the cavity of the uterus. This stage is reached
after the third month of gestation.</p>

<p>Another structure, concerning which just a word
must be said, is that known as the &ldquo;placenta,&rdquo; or more
commonly as the &ldquo;after-birth.&rdquo; We need only say
that this is first developed by means of a number of
little outgrowths by means of which the early embryo
is attached to the wall of the cavity in which it lies.
These outgrowths grow into the uterine tissue around
the ovum, and they allow of blood circulating between
them. They have, as a matter of fact, two distinct
functions to perform&mdash;first, that of fixing the ovum in
position, and, secondly, they allow of the maternal
blood circulating in the spaces between them, and it
is from this blood that the embryo derives its nourishment.
The blood-vessels ultimately connect with those
of the umbilicus, and thence reach the embryo. This
organ, the placenta, at the time the embryo is fully
developed at birth, is a round structure about nine
inches across, and not quite an inch thick in its middle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
becoming thinner towards the edges. The surface of
it next to the infant is smooth and shiny, beneath which
it is rough, that next to the maternal structures being
dark-coloured, somewhat like flesh. When the child
is born, the severing of the umbilical cord allows the
placenta to remain behind in the uterine cavity, whence
it is usually expelled shortly afterwards. Should,
however, this not be done, and the embryo and the
placenta be born together, the child is said to be &ldquo;born
with a caul,&rdquo; an event which has given rise to many
superstitions.</p>

<p>The foregoing description of the principal events in
the development of the embryo will be sufficient for
our purpose here. Further details on the subject would
necessitate a considerable knowledge of physiology and
anatomy, and those readers who desire to study the
details of the subject further may do so in any of the
various works referred to in the bibliography appended
to this book.</p>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS</h3>

<p>We may next turn our attention to the developing
embryo at a very early stage, and note from which
parts of its growing cells the different structures are
ultimately developed, remembering all the while that
all the subsequent division into specialised tissues is
the result of the inherent possibilities in one single
fertilised germ-cell.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, as the result of the subdivision
of the fertilised germ-cell, we had the formation
of three distinct layers of cells. These layers we
saw were termed the germinal layers, and were named
respectively the &ldquo;ectoderm,&rdquo; the &ldquo;entoderm,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;mesoderm&rdquo;&mdash;the last appearing between the two
former. It is from these three germinal layers that
all the subsequent structures of the body take their
origin, and although we cannot attempt to follow out
in detail the growth of all these special tissues, it will,
nevertheless, be of interest to note, in the briefest
possible way, from which portion of the embryo they
subsequently arise. Some of these we may afterwards
note in detail. The total result may be summarised
by simply giving a list of the various tissues, and the
corresponding embryonic layer from which they come.

<p>From the above very brief summary we see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the body of the individual, with all its component
tissues and parts, can be divided, as regards its origin,
into three groups according as to which embryonic
layer was concerned in its development. Moreover,
if these three groups be scrutinised a little more carefully,
they will be seen to differ very markedly from
each other in the structures and tissues which are
derived from them. Thus the structures from the
entoderm (see C) are practically either in the nature
of glands, or the lining of the alimentary tract. Those
tissues coming from the mesoderm (see B), on the
other hand, comprise most of what may be termed
the supporting tissues of the body, such as the bones
and the muscles and ligaments, as well as the vessels
which constitute the great circulation of the blood and
lymph. But perhaps the most remarkable of all is
the list of structures which take their origin from the
ectoderm of the embryo (see A). In this list will be
found the most important structures in the whole
human body, as well as some of those which are apparently
of far less serious importance. It is rather
surprising to find, for example, that the whole of the
nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord,
and the organs of special sensation, should be derived
from the same layer of cells as gives rise to the very
simple cells of the skin, which serve merely as a protective
covering to the other tissues. It is curious
also to observe that in addition to brain and skin,
parts of the teeth also arise from this external layer.
Evidently then this ectoderm or outer layer is of the
very greatest importance in embryology, since from it
arise all those parts of the embryo itself which are the
most important in its future life.</p>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS (<i>continued</i>)</h3>

<p>We have now considered, as far as is compatible with
the character of a work of this kind, the beginning
and development of the embryo taken as a whole, and
for the remaining part of our study of this subject we
may devote our attention to the beginnings of some
of the more important organs and functions in the new
individual. It will be impossible to deal in detail
with all the important parts which ultimately constitute
the new personality, but a selection may be made
which will give some general idea of how great results
spring from very small beginnings. What will be
said here it may be hoped will be just sufficient to
stimulate the interest of those to whom the subject
appeals, and who may then turn their attention to
some of the larger works which go into greater detail
in this subject, a list of which will be found in the
bibliography at the end of this volume.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that quite a large number of
the characteristics that we usually associate with a
normal human being only come into existence, or at
any rate only become obvious, at some period longer
or shorter after birth. True, these characteristics
depend for their ultimate appearance upon the development
of the corresponding structures and organs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the growing embryo, but in the case of some of these,
those organs are not fully developed in embryonic life,
and the manifestation of the functions associated with
them may be delayed perhaps for years. This is notably
the case, for example, with the reproductive organs
which, though developed during the life of the embryo,
remain functionless until the period of adolescence.
The development of the human mind and intellect too,
although depending, of course, upon the embryonic
growth of the brain and the nervous system generally,
is a matter of time and the environment subsequent to
birth. It should be realised, however, in this connection,
that the mind of the new individual, and all that
is involved in that term, dates back ultimately, as
regards its possibilities, to the moment at which the
two germ-cells from the male and female respectively
united in fertilisation. The adult mind develops from
the mind of the infant. The infant mind appears as
the result of the possibilities and the tendencies which
were inherent in the germ-cells from which not merely
the brain but the whole embryo sprang; in other words,
all that a single human mind connotes results from the
possibilities in a single cell. Such a thought is a
startling one indeed, and at first sight appears, perhaps,
somewhat incredible. But a moment's careful attention
to the problem will show at once that it is in reality
no more wonderful than the fact that this single cell
produces all the millions of other cells which in due
time give rise to the skin, bone, nerve, blood, and so
forth, which make up the entire body of the embryo.
The human mind, therefore&mdash;and indeed the human
soul, if that term be used in any intelligible sense&mdash;takes
its origin in the products of the multiplications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of germ-cells acted upon by their subsequent surroundings.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>With this passing reference to the fact that some
important parts of an individual only grow to their
full manifestations after embryonic life, we may pass
to the consideration of the development of some of the
more interesting parts of the embryo itself.</p>

<p>Amongst the most striking, and certainly the most
interesting, of the various parts of the developing
embryo, those which go to form the special senses are
prominent. They are interesting not merely from their
actual mode of growth, but especially also in connection
with their evolutionary history. The study of how they
have come into their present state in the higher animals
leads us back to very small beginnings&mdash;indeed, to the
time when there was no such thing as special sense
organs for sight, hearing, smell, and so forth, but where
the organism had what may be termed a diffused tactual
sense over and throughout the entire body. In the
course of time this diffused general sense became
specialised, no better example of which could be quoted
than that of the sense of sight, which was referred to,
as many of our readers will doubtless remember, in
Tyndall's famous Belfast address. He was referring
to Herbert Spencer's theory of the manner in which
vision was evolved. He pointed out that, as above
noted, in the lowest organisms sensation is a general
thing diffused throughout the body, a kind of general
tactual sense. As the result of environment, and
gradual adaptation to external influences, certain parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of the general surface of the organism became more
responsive to these external stimuli than other parts.
These areas, being those points at which sensation was
most acutely felt, were nothing more or less than
primitive sense organs. Thus in the progress of evolution
the stimulus of the eye gradually became most
pronounced in certain cells which contain pigment,
these cells being more responsive to the light stimulus
than the rest of the body. That was the beginning of
an eye; a group of cells more receptive, more easily
influenced by light, than any other cells. In a slightly
higher stage of evolution we find a special overgrowth
of the skin which covers over the area in which these
pigmented cells lie, obviously a protective measure
on behalf of the specialised cells referred to. Then,
still later, a lens is added, and the whole organ becomes
more and more adapted to the necessities of the case,
until it reaches the extraordinary perfection that is
seen in the eye of such a bird as an eagle. On the
same general principle, the other special senses also took
their origin from this general diffused tactual sense,
certain cells becoming specially adapted for receiving
the stimulus of sound, others for taste, others for smell,
and so forth.</p>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS (<i>continued</i>)</h3>

<p>It is not necessary to describe in detail the beginnings
of all the various structures which arise from that
important layer of cells in the embryo which is termed
the ectoderm; but since it gives rise to that part of
the embryo, which eminently places man in the first
place in the world of animals, we may select it for a
little further description. We may leave out of account
the beginnings of the skin and the glands, and some
other parts, and look for the moment at the origin of
the nervous system, which includes the brain, the
spinal cord, and the whole nervous mechanism of the
individual. Since man's prominence depends upon the
wonderful capacities in his nervous system, it is all
the more interesting to note from what small and
simple beginnings it has arisen.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, at a very early stage in
the development of the embryo, a folding of its cells
takes place, so that the upper embryonic area assumes
the character of a groove. We may confine our attention
to this groove for the moment, leaving out of
account the other two layers of the embryo&mdash;namely,
the mesoderm and the entoderm. It is this groove,
which thus early makes its appearance, which is subsequently
to play such a tremendous part in the formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of the most important structures. It is called
the &ldquo;medullary groove.&rdquo; As growth proceeds and the
cells continue to multiply and increase in numbers,
the two edges or lips of the groove gradually approximate,
and ultimately fuse together. Obviously the
effect of this is to transform what was the groove into
a closed cavity or canal, which is therefore now termed
the medullary canal. Arising in this simple manner,
this equally simple structure is destined to become the
central canal of the spinal cord, and the cavities in the
brain, known as the ventricles. The walls of this
canal, be it remembered, are composed of cells of the
layer of ectoderm, and it is these cells which, as we
saw, appeared very early in the development of the
embryo that are now to proceed to develop into the
brain, spinal cord, and, in fact, the whole central
nervous system. At first the cells appear all similar,
but, as development goes on, they begin to differentiate
themselves into different kinds, some forming the actual
nervous cells of the brain and spinal cord, others
developing into protective structures.</p>

<p>The hinder or posterior part of this medullary groove
and canal is narrower than the anterior portion. This
posterior narrower part is that which gives rise to the
spinal cord. It very soon changes its character by
the appearance of a number of constrictions at intervals
running along its whole length. It becomes, as it is
termed, segmented. A little later these successive
segments are seen to correspond to the pairs of spinal
nerves which arise from the cord. For the first part
of embryonic life the developing spinal cord is of the
same length as the canal, but as time goes on the canal
grows longer than the cord. This involves the nerves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
coming from the hinder portion growing longer than
others. It is the front or anterior portion of this
medullary canal which is concerned in the development
of the brain itself, and here, at an early stage, two
very obvious constrictions appear in the region of
what is to be the brain, and these constrictions divide
that brain area into three distinct parts, or vesicles.
Part of the posterior vesicle ultimately develops into
the <i>cerebellum</i>, or little brain. Another part forms the
<i>medulla oblongata</i>, that important hind brain in which
lie so many of the vital centres of nervous energy.
The central cavity formed by these constrictions is of
comparatively less importance, forming ultimately what
is known as the <i>mid-brain</i>. The foremost or anterior
vesicle, however, is of the very greatest importance,
and its subsequent changes are more marked than
either of the other two. From it is developed the
great mass of the cerebrum itself, together with various
outgrowths from it which have most important functions.
Thus two of these outgrowths appear projecting
from the lower part of the sides of the walls, and
ultimately coming to reach the outer ectoderm. These
two projections, or pouches, ultimately form the optic
vesicle. Still later in development the whole of the
anterior vesicle is again constricted, thus forming two
distinct parts, the foremost of which, growing rapidly
in two halves on either side of the middle line, ultimately
give rise to the two cerebral hemispheres.
These two cerebral hemispheres, therefore, arise, in
the first place, as lateral enlargements of the anterior
part of one of the primitive constrictions of the medullary
canal. In their outer layers cells continue to
make their appearance with great rapidity, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
is formed the cerebral cortex; and the remarkable
thing about this all-important part of the brain itself
is that all the cells of this cerebral cortex appear to
be produced during the life of the embryo; there
being in all probability none added after birth has
occurred. That is to say, the possibilities of the actual
physical growth of brain tissue in any given embryo
are fixed from the beginning. Brain tissue, in other
words, is born, not made. It is the manner in which
it is treated afterwards upon which depends whether
that given quantity of brain-cells displays its best
potentialities or not.<br /><br /><br /></p>

</div>

<p>We have seen that the optic structures are concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with this front portion of the developing brain.
The same is true of the organs which are concerned
with the special sense of smell; for about the fourth
week of the life of a human embryo there appears on
the under surface of each of the cerebral hemispheres,
towards the front, a prolongation which becomes the
olfactory lobes.</p>

<p>It is well known that the surface of the brain of an
adult human being, or, indeed, of any of the higher
vertebrates, shows upon its surface a number of convolutions,
and it is generally recognised, from a study
of the comparison of different vertebrate brains, that
the more convoluted is the surface of the adult brain
the more highly developed is the animal concerned,
from the point of view of brain power. The surface of
the cerebral hemispheres, however, is quite smooth
for some months of embryonic life, and the depressions
which give rise to the appearance of the convolutions
do not show themselves until about the fifth
month, at which stage the brain is relatively large.</p>

<p>We referred on a previous page to the origin in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
evolution of visual sensation, and it may be of interest
here to note a little more fully the beginnings of the
eye itself in the embryo. As has been said, the very
first appearance of these organs takes the form of a
pair of outgrowths, or processes, which are hollow,
from the front part of the anterior vesicle of the brain.
These grow until they reach the ectoderm. A remarkable
change then takes place. The portion of the
hollow vesicle which reaches the outermost embryonic
layer becomes folded in upon itself so as to form a cup
with a double wall; just as one might form a cup in
a blown-up paper bag by forcibly pressing one portion
of it into the other. This double-walled cup is of special
interest, because from its walls is ultimately developed
that very important structure in connection with sight,
namely, the retina. As soon as this is completed
cells begin to grow from it towards the brain in the form
of nerve fibres, and these in time convert what was
originally a hollow process or growth into a solid mass
of nerve tissue. This mass is the optic nerve. Thus
is completed the connection between the outer surface
of the eye and the brain itself, which is to receive the
sensation. Then the ectoderm on the surface over
the cup begins to thicken, grows into the cup itself,
and ultimately forms a rounded hollow mass which we
afterwards recognise as the <i>lens</i> of the eye. Still later
this becomes separated from the surface by another
layer of cells constituting the <i>cornea</i>, and outside that
again is still another layer which makes the <i>conjunctiva</i>.</p>

<p>Subsequently the contents of this cup become filled
up from other sources with a soft gelatinous tissue.
Then the eyelids in time make their appearance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
shape of folds of skin growing over the eye, and remaining
in contact until very shortly before birth occurs.
And so we see that from this wonderful layer of ectoderm
there comes gradually into existence not only the brain
itself and the spinal cord, with all the nerves, but also
the special sense organs of sight and smell.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF THINGS (<i>continued</i>)</h3>

<p>Without entering into the description of the development
of the whole circulatory system, we may just
mention briefly the origin of the heart itself, which
begins at a very early stage by the appearance of a
small body of cells, which come to arrange themselves
in a tubular form enclosed in the mesoderm. The two
halves of this tube are at first quite separate from each
other, but gradually come together and finally unite
into a single tube with walls. The folds of these ultimately
form the heart muscle. The organ, at this stage
of its development, does not lie within the region of
the chest cavity, as it afterwards does, but more anteriorly
in the region of the neck. The simple tubular
arrangement, however, is quite a passing phase, and as
the tube increases in length it becomes bent upon
itself, somewhat in the form of the letter S. One end
of it now enlarges and forms a pouch on each side,
these forming the two auricles, right and left. From
these auricles a partition grows vertically, and when
complete, cuts them off from each other, except that
a communication is left in the upper part (<i>the foramen
ovale</i>) which closes up after birth. This partition allows
of the blood from one side of the heart passing to the
other. Another partition eventually divides off that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
portion which has formed the auricles from the remaining
portion which develops into the ventricles, which
in their turn become again divided by a still further
partition. In this way the heart which, in the first
place, was a simple tube, grows ultimately into an
organ with four distinct chambers, two auricles and two
ventricles, the only difference from this and the adult
heart being the communication which exists through
the partition separating the two auricles.</p>

<p>The development of the organ of hearing is somewhat
complicated. The first part to appear is a portion of
the inner ear, which shows itself as a round, hollowing
of the ectoderm. This depression becomes deeper
and sinks further in, while its floor becomes thicker,
and finally the whole assumes the shape of a closed
cavity. An outgrowth from this gives rise to the
<i>cochlea</i>. The cavity becomes divided into two portions,
in one of which the <i>semicircular canals</i> arise. Around
the whole, the embryonic tissue has been forming into
a strong protective covering, some of which finally
becomes cartilage, and some bone. The middle portion
of the ear is the remains of a cleft in the side of the
embryo. This cleft becomes changed into a canal by
the closing of its edges, the upper part ultimately
forming the <i>tympanic cavity</i>, and the rest of it remaining
as the <i>Eustachian canal</i>. This canal opens into the
pharynx. In the cavity there are subsequently developed
three small bones which play an important part
in the process of hearing. After the birth of the embryo,
air reaches the tympanic cavity, which then enlarges.
One of the walls of this cavity persists as the tympanic
membrane or drum. Finally the outer ear, that portion
which is popularly spoken of as <i>the</i> ear, is formed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the upper portion of the same cleft which gave rise to
the tube of the tympanum.</p>

<p>We have referred in the preceding description to the
origin of some embryonic structures from a cleft in
the early embryo itself. As a matter of fact, no less
than four of these clefts, or fissures, appear in the region
of the neck on each side, and are of the very greatest
interest and importance in connection with embryology.
They are termed the &ldquo;branchial clefts,&rdquo; and
are seen in the embryos of all vertebrates. In the
human embryo there are four. They are situated on
each side of the pharynx, and they correspond to
the gill slits in lower vertebrates.</p>

<p>Amongst other structures which arise from the
important layer of ectoderm are the teeth. Of these
there are during life two sets, a temporary and a permanent.
The temporary teeth, though they do not
make their appearance till after the birth of the embryo,
still are partly developed during embryonic life, lying
embedded in the tissues until the familiar process
known as &ldquo;cutting the teeth&rdquo; takes place. This is,
of course, merely the time of their external appearance.
The first stage in the development, however, is
a thickening of the epithelium of the gums in a direction
which is to correspond with the line where the
teeth will eventually pierce. This thickening is called
the &ldquo;dental ridge.&rdquo; This grows downwards into the
underlying tissue in flask-shaped growths. From the
neck of each of these flasks there is a small projection
which indicates where the permanent teeth will ultimately
be. This first stage is termed that of the <i>enamel
germ</i>. This becomes surrounded by cells which ultimately
form a <i>dental sac</i>. Next, tissue from below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
grows into the flask, and the further growth of this
gives rise to the <i>enamel organ</i>. Finally, enamel itself
and dentine are developed, and the embryonic tooth
remains covered under the gums until it cuts them.</p>

<p>So far we have considered merely the mode of development
of the most important organs of the body, but
we have said nothing of the most important supporting
structure, namely, the skeleton. The earliest appearance
of anything in the shape of a skeleton is the
structure known as the notochord, a structure of
immense importance and interest in the embryology
of all vertebrate animals, in which it is a temporary
thing only. The first appearance of this notochord
in lower animals is the earliest indication of the vertebrate
type, because it is found that in the higher
vertebrates it is the forerunner of the bony spinal
column and the skull. It appears first as a groove
underneath the medullary groove, of which we have
already spoken, and its two lips unite to form a cavity,
as did those of the medullary groove. In this case,
however, the groove becomes a solid rod, then termed
the notochord, and it lies immediately under the medullary
groove itself, which, as we have seen, gives rise
to the central nervous system. In the course of
development, masses of cells come to arrange themselves
on each side of the notochord, which they eventually
include, and at the same time they grow upwards
and around the spinal cord which is thus enclosed.
Later on these surrounding portions become cartilage,
and, still later, bone; the notochord meanwhile gradually
disappearing where the bony spinal column appears.
This primitive vertebrate structure therefore, of the
notochord, has the all-important function of coming to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
enclose, and thus protect, the spinal cord and nervous
system.</p>

<p>As regards the other bones of the body, all that
need be said here is that they are preceded by the
structure which we know as cartilage, and in the bones
of the limbs at two or three different points this cartilage
begins to be transformed into bone. These points
are known as centres of ossification.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>HOW THE EMBRYO IS NOURISHED</h3>

<p>Having noted how the embryo itself takes its origin,
and then studied something of the beginnings of some
of its most important parts, we may now very briefly
refer to the subject of its own nourishment. This has
more than a mere academic interest, because obviously
the proper growth and development of all the various
tissues and structures in the embryo must depend
ultimately upon the nourishment with which they are
supplied. Their own inherent characters cause them
to divide and subdivide so as to give rise to the millions
of cells which are required to make the body, but these
cells, in their turn, are dependent upon outside sources
for the nourishment which enables them to keep on
growing, or to maintain their full growth when they
have arrived at that stage.</p>

<p>Nature has made many varied arrangements for
this nutrition during embryonic life in different classes
of animals. In some a considerable quantity of yolk
is so arranged with reference to the embryo that the
latter can draw upon it for some time for its supplies.
This is the case, of course, in birds, and in some reptiles.
We need here, however, only consider the case of the
human embryo.</p>

<p>Three sets of structures are concerned in human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
embryonic nourishment, namely, the Allantois, the
Villi of the Chorion, and the Placenta.</p>

<p>The Allantois is developed in the form of a hollow
bud from the posterior part of the primitive alimentary
canal, and ultimately comes to form the umbilical cord,
and the embryonic part of the placenta. It is this
structure, the allantois, which allows at a very early
date of the embryo establishing a blood-connection
with the maternal tissues, and hence it plays a very
important part in the transmission of nourishment to
the embryo. Not only does it do this, but it allows
of the removal of waste products.</p>

<p>The villi of the chorion are outgrowths by means
of which the very early embryo attaches itself to the
walls of the cavity, which it has made for itself in the
wall of the uterus. As they grow larger, these villi
push their way into many of the small blood-vessels
in the uterine wall, and so come to lie actually in a
mass of blood from which they abstract the elements
of nutrition. At first the villi themselves contain no
blood-vessels. Nourishment passes through them by
a simple process of osmosis. Later on, vessels grow
into the villi themselves. The nutriment supply is
secretion, in the first place, of the uterine glands,
which these villi easily absorb. This process takes
place during the first two or three months of
embryonic life. At the end of this time most of the
villi disappear, and the few that remain take part
in forming the f&oelig;tal or embryonic portion of the
placenta.</p>

<p>After the third month the embryo is nourished by
the placenta itself, which is at this stage developed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
As we have seen, it arises partly from the villi of the
chorion, which is its embryonic portion. The other
part of it is maternal in origin, arising from the portion
of the uterine wall which is immediately over the
embryo. The connection between this structure, the
placenta and the embryo, is constituted by means of
the umbilical cord. The function of the placenta is
partly to supply nutrition, partly to serve as an organ
of respiration for the embryo, whose lungs are, of course,
not functional, and partly it acts in the same way as
the kidney does in after life, by excreting certain products.
From the placenta the embryo derives those
food elements at first provided by the secretion of the
uterine glands. Afterwards these elements are supplied
by cells which lie between the f&oelig;tal villi and the blood
of the mother. Its respiratory function consists in
allowing oxygen and carbonic acid gas to pass by
osmosis between the embryonic and the maternal
blood. The process is exactly analogous to that which
takes place between the gills of a fish and the water
in which the fish lies. Of course, it will be easily
understood that there is as yet no great need for a
large supply of oxygen, because the embryo is merely
growing, and not using its various organs.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that under ordinary
conditions of embryonic life there is no direct mixture
of the blood of the mother and that of the developing
embryo. All the processes which contribute to its
growth and maintenance, including those of respiration
and excretion, take place through the intermediate
structures above mentioned. This is an extremely
important point, because it means&mdash;and evidently that
is the object of the arrangement&mdash;that there may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
much of an injurious character in the blood of the
mother which never reaches the embryonic tissues at
all. Doubtless the cells which form the organs of
nutrition for the embryo have a capacity for selecting
the elements required for purposes of nutrition. It
is their business to look after this process. How perfectly
it is performed can at once be understood when
we recollect how very frequently the tissues of the
mother herself are in anything but perfect health, and
yet the embryo is born healthy. Were it not for this
intermediary process, the embryo could hardly help
being poisoned or otherwise injured by all the varied
unhealthy products and substances which the ignorance
of some mothers allows to be present in their blood
during this important period. Even with this means
of protection, the maternal blood may be so utterly
deficient in nutritive qualities, or so actively injurious
from saturation with alcohol, or from some equally
toxic substance, that the fluids which reach the embryonic
cells may be very much impaired in quality.
Nevertheless, it is astonishing how much danger can
be avoided in this way by Nature's provision in the
method of nourishing the embryo.</p>

<p>If the development and growth of the embryo in a
human being runs a perfectly normal and uninterrupted
course, the following points could be observed
at various stages. At the end of the fourth week in
growth, the embryo is distinctly curved, so that the
two ends&mdash;the head and the tail&mdash;are close together,
the whole being about half an inch in length. Even
at this very early stage, the canal which gives rise to
the brain and spinal cord is closed in. The vesicles
of the eye and the ear have both made their appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and the limbs are just beginning to show as
buds. The heart is quite obvious, and its division
into its four chambers is commencing. In another
four weeks the embryo has reached the size of one
inch, and the head is beginning to take on a shape
more resembling that associated with a human being.
The tail, on the other hand, has now disappeared.
The limbs have grown to the extent that both hands
and feet are starting growth, and in the region of the
head both the eyes and the ears, as well as the nose,
can be distinguished. Even at this stage, however,
the sex of the embryo cannot be made out. A month
later, at the end of the twelfth week, a considerable
development has taken place. The embryo is now
about three and a half inches long. There is a general
growth to be observed, and the bones are beginning
to ossify. In sixteen weeks, when the embryo measures
about five inches in length, the sex is easily distinguishable.
The most characteristic thing for the weeks
succeeding this is the relatively large size of the head,
upon which hair appears at about the twenty-fourth
week. In twenty-eight weeks the embryo should weigh
about 2&nbsp;lb., that is to say at the seventh month of
embryonic life. Should the child be born at this time
as the result of any of the causes which give rise to
premature birth, there is a possibility that it may
live, though as a rule it does not. Four weeks later
it should weigh 3&nbsp;lb., and if born now may frequently
live, if carefully attended to. In another four weeks
the embryo is nearly eighteen inches long, and weighs
about 5&nbsp;lb., and the body has a more rounded appearance,
because by this time there has been a considerable
growth in fat. If born at this stage it ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
be quite possible to save the life. Finally, at the end
of forty weeks, the normal full embryonic period of
human life, the healthy child should weigh about 7&nbsp;lb.,
having smooth, pink skin, and being otherwise perfectly
developed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>RECAPITULATION</h3>

<p>In bringing our study of Embryology to a close, we
may glance briefly at another aspect of the subject,
namely, that which emphasizes the fact that in its
development the embryo recapitulates the history of
its ancestors.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that the offspring of any species
of animal, if they are to live and survive in the same
kind of environment as that in which their parents
live, must resemble them somewhat closely. The only
way in which Nature can secure such a sufficiently
close resemblance of offspring to parents is by insuring
that they should develop along similar lines. So it is
that we find that the whole of the life history of an
individual is more or less a recapitulation, with, of
course, variations, of that of the parents and ancestors.
Each successive step from the very beginning of the
fertilisation of the ovum repeats a stage through which
previous generations have passed. If from any accident
a step in this recapitulation is omitted, the embryo is
to that extent deprived of some feature possessed by
a parent or ancestor; and if this be a sufficiently
important omission, it is impossible for such an embryo
to survive. That is one way in which an embryo may
differ from its parents. That is a retrogressive change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
On the other hand, such an embryo, in addition to
recapitulating the stages through which its parents
passed in development, may have something new
added, something which appears for the first time.
In other words a progressive variation may appear.</p>

<p>Now, since the embryo follows the same developmental
track as did the parent, passing through the
successive stages of germ-cells, fertilised ovum, embryo,
f&oelig;tus, infant, child, youth, and adult, it follows that
should it exhibit any additional peculiarity, unnoted
in the parent, the embryo has obviously varied progressively.
That is to say, it has pursued the same
line of development together with some new addition.
On the other hand, should the offspring at any of
these stages in its career be obviously without some
of the characters of previous generations, it is as certainly
due to the fact that the recapitulation of the
history of development has been, in that particular,
incomplete.</p>

<p>In all successive cases of multicellular organisms,
development by a process of repetition of what happened
in the previous generation seems to be the rule;
and it would appear that only by this means could a
mass of cells which constitute an individual grow into
something sufficiently like the parents as to be recognised
for their offspring. Given the fact that a
human individual starts from a single germ-cell, it
could only be by following the same steps in development
trodden by the parent that the new individual
could attain a similar growth. The object of this
similarity is, of course, to provide that the offspring
may live and survive in an environment more or less
similar to that of the parents. As Dr. Archdall Reid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
puts it, &ldquo;the embryo starting from the same point,
must follow the same road to reach the same
goal. The embryo which did not recapitulate the
history of the development of a parent would be a
monstrosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While, however, recapitulation in development is
always more or less clear, it does not follow that it
is perfectly complete, nor perfectly identical with the
development of the parent. Indeed, on the other
hand, there is always a certain amount of variation,
either progressive or retrogressive. Progressive variation
means that in addition to the development of
all the parental stages, something new has been added.
Retrogressive variation means that from the total
development experienced by the parent, something has
been omitted. We are here speaking of characters
of a species, and it must not be thought that we are
referring to the characters of the embryo as if they
were derived from those of their parents. This was
clearly pointed out in the earlier portion of our study.
The variations in development, to which we here refer,
take their origin in the germ-plasm which tends to
repeat in each generation similar types of development.
In other words the germ-plasm from which individuals
spring is of such a nature that the embryos arising
from it show in their development a recapitulation of
the evolution of their particular species. In addition
they may show variations of either a plus or a minus
character. These variations are frequently inherited,
and persist throughout succeeding generations. In
course of time, if there are many of such variations,
they accumulate, and to that extent, of course, alter
the life history. That is why in watching the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of a human embryo it is impossible to trace
accurately the early ancestral development of the race
from it. It passes through the stage of a single cell,
then becomes multicellular, and gradually assumes
the form of a higher and higher type of organism.
&ldquo;Manifestly the additions and subtractions have been
vast. It possesses, for instance, a placenta, an organ
by which it is attached to the mother, through which
it is nourished, and which at one time is larger than
the embryo itself; but which, of course, could not
have been present in its prototypes. Nevertheless the
life history unfolded by the child is just as real, just
as complete, and probably more accurate than any
written chronicle that attempts to describe the whole
past of a race.&rdquo; (Reid.)</p>

<p>Here we must conclude this brief sketch of some
of the principal facts in the science of Embryology,
in the hope that enough has been said to stimulate
the interest of our readers in this subject to such
an extent that they may be encouraged to pursue
its study still further in one of the many textbooks
that are devoted entirely, or partly, to this
matter.</p>

<p>We would urge in conclusion that the study is well
worth while, even for those to whom it has a non-professional
interest. It should be sufficiently obvious
to any earnest thinker that the problems which are
involved in the study of embryology are precisely
those which are of the very greatest importance to
humanity at large. With this subject is most intimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
bound up that of heredity itself, which has
been dealt with in another volume of this series. No
true understanding of what can be done, or what
should be done, in the direction of improving the lot
of generations to come, or of making the most of the
generation at present existent, can be obtained by any
who are absolutely ignorant of these topics. It is
only by their study that we realise that the human
embryo, which is to become the human individual,
consists, to a very large extent, of characters and
features which are unalterably settled for it beforehand,
to which nothing can be added, and from which
nothing can be taken away. In other words, the possibilities
for any individual are those which are pre-existent
in the germ-plasm from which he or she
originates. These possibilities, however, depend upon
the environment in which the embryo, infant, child,
and adult is subsequently placed for their full expansion.
In many directions the inherited tendencies
transmitted by the continuity of germ-plasm are unalterably
and strictly defined. In many other directions
these inherited tendencies can be so modified,
drawn out, or even partially suppressed, by suitable
surroundings of a hygienic, educative, and moral nature,
that if the process be taken in hand sufficiently early
wonderful successes may result. These results are
those for which the social reformer and the philanthropist
and the serious student of sociology are earnestly
striving, but it is only by a study of the sciences of
Heredity and Embryology that accurate data can be
obtained from which justifiable conclusions may be
drawn.</p>

<p>The great fact which embryology teaches is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
past is unfolded stage by stage, with certain omissions
and additions, so that in very truth&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="BIBLIOGRAPHY" id="BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>The following books will be found to deal in detail
with some of the general questions in the foregoing
pages:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Laws of Heredity</i>. By G. Archdall Reid, M.B.,
F.R.S.E. (London. Methuen.) This great work
should be read by all who are interested in the subject
of Heredity and all the problems involved in it.
It deals in an exhaustive and interesting manner with
the characteristics of living beings, the method of
development, the function of sex, the present evolution
of man, and kindred topics.</p>

<p><i>The Greatest Life</i>. By Gerald Leighton, M.D.,
F.R.S.E. (London. Duckworth.) This work deals
with the development of character (as well as structures)
from the biological point of view. The argument
is that the <i>whole</i> of a man, mental, moral, spiritual,
as well as what is usually termed physical, develops in
accordance with biological laws.</p>

<p><i>Text-books on Physiology</i>. Any of the standard books
will be found to contain accounts of the early development
of the embryo and its various tissues.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
